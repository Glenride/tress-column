## How it works

### Configure

The creator sets everything in one launch() transaction: total supply, the distribution split, vesting terms, lock mode, and launch guards. The split must add up exactly — vesting + airdrop + liquidity = 100% — checked on-chain before the launch exists.

### Lock

The factory deploys the token, the pool, and the locker with those terms written into immutable fields. There is no function that writes launch state after construction. No owner. No pause. No upgrade path. If it isn't in the contract at launch, it does not exist.

### Prove

Every launch mints exactly one certificate holding the full record in plain language — supply, splits, lock, vesting, fee mode, gate. Written once, by the factory, in the launch transaction. Nobody has to take anyone's word for any of it.

## Six parts, one job each

No backstage. Every actor in a Tress Column launch is named, and each one's power ends exactly where its job does.

- **Creator (the person):** Configures the launch once, in the open — then cannot change anything. Their discipline is the product.
- **Trader (the person):** Reads the certificate, then trades the pool. The terms they read are the terms the contracts enforce.
- **Factory (the contract):** Deploys everything in the launch transaction and freezes the terms into immutable fields.
- **Hook (the contract):** Guards the launch window and applies the launch's fee rule — nothing below its gate, its configured rate in quote asset above it.
- **Certificate (the record):** The full launch record, written once, kept on-chain, readable by anyone forever.
- **Locker (the contract):** Holds the liquidity. Abyssal locks have no withdrawal function at all; timed locks enforce a 180-day floor.
